## 

- BoolBinding
  These classes bind a boolean state represented by LiveData<Boolean> to a boolean property of view.
  For example EnableBinding bind a boolean state to isEnabled property of a view.  
  CheckBinding class supports TowWay binding mode for CompoundButtons such as CheckBox, Switch, ToggleButton, and so on.
  The classes named Multi*Binding allow to bind a boolean state to properties of one or more views.
  AnimationBinding and FadeInOutBinding bind a boolean state to visibility of a view with animation effects.

- TextBinding / EditTextBinding
  These classes bind a string value such as LiveData<String> or MutableLiveData<String> to a text property of view.
  TextBinding supports only OneWay binding mode for TextView, Button, and so on.
  EditTextBinding for EditText supports TwoWay binding mode.
  NumberBinding / EditNumberBinding (and the sub-classes of it) are inherited from TextBinding / EditTextBinding respectively, 
  and bind input string to numeric value such as LiveData<Int> / MutableLiveData<Int>.
  
- ProgressBarBinding / SeekBarBinding / SliderBinding

  ProgressBarBinding supports OneWay binding mode for ProgressBar.
  SeekBarBinding and SliderBinding support TwoWay binding progress value to the property of SeekBar and Slider that is one of the material component respectively.
  Additionally, these classes support OneWay binding of the range properties such as min/max in ProgressBar and SeekBar, or valueFrom/valueTo in Slider.
  
- RadioGroupBinding family

  RadioGroupBinding is for RadioGroup and it binds any value-list (enum class values, typically) to selection of radio buttons.
  Similarly, MaterialRadioButtonGroupBinding and MaterialToggleButtonGroupBinding are for MaterialButtonToggleGroup 
  as radio buttons and toggle buttons respectively.
